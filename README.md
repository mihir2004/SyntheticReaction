# Synthetic Reaction

This repository contains code and resources for the Synthetic Reaction project, focusing on various computational models and techniques related to synthetic reactions.

## About

The project aims to provide tools and models for simulating and analyzing synthetic reactions. It includes modules for completion, extrapolation, and reconstruction of reaction data.

## Contents

- `Completion/`: Code and resources for reaction completion.
- `Extrapolation/`: Code and resources for reaction extrapolation.
- `Reconstruction/`: Code and resources for reaction reconstruction.
- `model/`: Machine learning models used in the project.
- `server/`: Server-side code for deploying models and tools.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Machine Learning**: Various models for reaction simulation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mihir2004/SyntheticReaction.git
   cd SyntheticReaction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
